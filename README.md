# Personal Snippets for UltiSnips

This is my collection of personal snippets for use with the UltiSnips plugin for Vim.
It includes snippets for JavaScipt, Ruby and Elixir, and their test ramework-specific code.

## Usage

Clone the snippets folder to ~/.vim/ and add the following lines to .vimrc:

let g:UltiSnipsSnippetsDir="~/.vim/UltiSnips"
let g:UltiSnipsSnippetDirectories=["UltiSnips"]
